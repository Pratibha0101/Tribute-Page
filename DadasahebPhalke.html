      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p1>Hello everyone, my name is Pratibha and I am here to write about <strong>Dhundiraj Govind Phalke</strong>,
        popularly
        known as <em>Dadasaheb Phalke</em> (30 April 1870 - 16 February 1944), The Father of Indian Cinema.
        <br><br>
        Dhundiraj Phalke was born on 30 April 1870 at <em>Trimbak</em>, Bombay Presidency into a Marathi-speaking
        <em>Chitpavan Brahmin</em> family. His father, Govind Sadashiv Phalke alias Dajishastri, was a Sanskrit scholar
        and
        worked as a Hindu priest conducting religious ceremonies and his mother, Dwarkabai, was a housewife.
        <br><br>
        Dajishastri taught Phalke to conduct religious rituals like yajna and dispensing of medicines. When he was
        appointed
        as a professor of Sanskrit in the Wilson College, Bombay, the family shifted its base to Bombay. Phalke
        completed his
        primary education in Trimbakeshwar and matriculation was done in Bombay.
        Phalke joined the Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay in 1885 and completed a one-year course in drawing. At the
        beginning
        of 1886, he accompanied his elder brother, Shivrampant, to Baroda where he married a girl from Marathe family.
        Later, he joined Kala Bhavan, the Faculty of Fine Arts, at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda and
        completed a
        course in Oil painting and Watercolor painting in 1890. He also achieved proficiency in architecture and
        modelling.
        In the same year, Phalke bought a film camera and started experimenting with photography, processing, and
        printing. He
        was awarded a gold medal for creating a model of an ideal theatre at the 1892 Industrial Exhibition of
        Ahmedabad.
        While his work was much appreciated, one of his fans presented him a "costly" camera, used for still
        photography.
        <br><br>
        In 1891, Phalke did a six-months course to learn the techniques of preparing half-tone blocks, photo-lithio, and
        three-colour ceramic photography.
        Principal Gajjar of Kala Bhavan sent Phalke to Ratlam to learn three-colour blockmaking, photolitho transfers,
        colotype and darkroom printing techniques under the guidance of Babulal Varuvalkar.
        He was given free studio space to start his still photo studio by the prominent Desai family for whom he also
        shot
        their family photo albums. He lost his wife and a child in the 1900 plague epidemic and decided to move to a
        different
        city.
        Phalke returned to Baroda and started photography business. It did not run well because of the myth spread
        across the
        city that the camera sucks up the energy from a person's body which leads to their death.
        He faced similar resistance from the Prince of Baroda who refused to take photographs with the assumptions that
        it
        would shorten his life. Though, the Prince was later convinced by Phalke who went on to advocate the benefits of
        photography in his court, it did not help Phalke's business.
        He started the business of painting the stage curtains for the drama companies. This got him some basic training
        in
        drama production and fetched him a few minor roles in the plays.
        Phalke learned magic tricks from a German magician who was on a tour in Baroda that time. This helped him use
        trick
        photography in his filmmaking. At the end of 1901, Phalke began to hold the public performances of magic using
        professional name of Professor Kelpha with letters of his last name in reverse order.
        In 1902, Phalke remarried to Girija Karandikar, niece of proprietor of Kirloskar Natak Mandali. Girija was
        renamed as
        Saraswati after the marriage. In 1903, he got a job as a photographer and draftsman at the Archaeological Survey
        of
        India.
        However, not satisfied with the job, Phalke resigned in 1906 and set up a printing press at Lonavla under the
        name of
        "Phalke Engraving and Printing Works" with R. G. Bhandarkar as a partner.
